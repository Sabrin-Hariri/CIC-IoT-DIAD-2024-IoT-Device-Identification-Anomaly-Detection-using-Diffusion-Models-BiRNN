CIC IoT-DIAD 2024: IoT Device Identification &amp; Anomaly Detection using Diffusion Models &amp; BiRNN
📌 Overview
This project presents an advanced approach for IoT device identification and cyberattack detection using Diffusion Models for oversampling combined with a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) classifier.

The project is based on the CIC IoT-DIAD 2024 dataset, a comprehensive cybersecurity dataset consisting of 105 IoT devices and covering 33 types of attacks classified into seven major categories:

DDoS Attacks
DoS Attacks
Reconnaissance (Recon) Attacks
Web-based Attacks
Brute Force Attacks
Spoofing Attacks
Mirai Attacks
The primary goal is to enhance IoT security by leveraging state-of-the-art generative AI models, achieving 99% accuracy in device classification and anomaly detection.

🧠 AI Techniques Used
1️⃣ Diffusion Models for Oversampling
Instead of traditional data augmentation techniques, diffusion models were used for oversampling to balance the dataset and improve classification performance. The following nine diffusion models were applied:

✅ UNet
✅ DDIM (Denoising Implicit Diffusion Models)
✅ DDPM (Denoising Probabilistic Diffusion Models)
✅ SBGM (Score-Based Generative Models)
✅ LDM (Latent Diffusion Models)
✅ Conditional Diffusion Models
✅ EBM (Energy-Based Models)
✅ DiffAutoencoder
✅ Variational Diffusion Models

2️⃣ BiRNN for Classification
After oversampling with diffusion models, a BiRNN classifier was used to:

Analyze temporal dependencies in IoT network traffic
Improve classification accuracy
Enhance anomaly detection effectiveness

📊 Results
The combination of diffusion-based oversampling and BiRNN classification significantly improved performance, achieving:

✅ 99% accuracy in attack detection
✅ Demonstrating the power of diffusion models in generating high-quality synthetic samples, which is particularly beneficial for cybersecurity datasets where attack instances may be imbalanced or scarce.
✅ Highlighting the strength of BiRNN with diffusion models, as the integration of diffusion-based oversampling with BiRNN improved feature representation, enhanced temporal pattern learning, and contributed to more robust anomaly detection.
